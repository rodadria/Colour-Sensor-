<h2>A BLEND OF SENSES</h2>

 <h6><i>by Jimin Chung, Adriana Rodriguez</i></h6>

<p> Incorporating our research studies of physical computting and the synesthesia topic of Chromesthesia, we decided to dedicate our project to bring more awarness of the topic itself. Using  software products such as the TCS3200, Cytron Easy MP3 Shield 
and LED's, we created a product that allowed  user engagement and awarness of the different elements Chromesthesia has to a particular user. </p>

```
//OSEPP TCS3200 Color sensor
#include <CytronEZMP3.h>
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>


CytronEZMP3 mp3;

int s0 = 8, s1 = 9, s2 = 10, s3 = 11;
//int flag = 0;
//int counter = 0;
```
